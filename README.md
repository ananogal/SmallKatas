# SmallKatas

A set of small Katas to improve my knowledge of the c# language.

### 1 - Vowels Remover

	Given a sentence, remove all the vowels it contains.

### 2 - Find Capitals

	Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.

### 3 - Plus One Array
	Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

	For example an array [2, 3, 9] equals 239, add one would return an array [2, 4, 0].

	[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6]

	Only positive, single digit integers are allowed in the array so the function should return null if any of the array values are negative or more than 10

	[1, -9] would return null.
